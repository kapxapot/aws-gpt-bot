    "step1": "<b>What is ChatGPT?</b>\n\nChatGPT is a computer neural network capable of understanding text, engaging in dialogue, and assisting users with various information-related tasks.\n\nChatGPT does not simply copy data from the internet. It simulates thinking. The algorithm analyzes information and structures the response to make it easy to read and relevant to the question.",
    "step2": "<b>ChatGPT Features</b>\n\nüìå Not a search engine.\nThe algorithm was trained on a dataset up to a certain point in the past and will not provide you with current information about the latest events. It should be noted that ChatGPT is increasingly catching up with the times and is now only slightly behind the present day.\n\nüìå Does not always tell the truth.\nThe algorithm may make mistakes if it was provided with inaccurate or insufficient information.\n\nüìå Requires result verification.\nThe algorithm may give an incorrect answer due to unclear question phrasing or misunderstanding of the context.\n\n‚ùóÔ∏è Therefore, it is important to learn how to properly formulate tasks for the bot. This way, it will become a useful assistant for you in the tasks you are trying to solve.",
    "step3": "<b>Working with the Bot</b>\n\n1. Assign a role to the bot.\n\nFor example:\nüîπ \"I want you to act as a marketer.\"\nüîπ \"Respond like the character (character's name) from the movie (movie name).\"\n\n The bot modes include several preset roles, and you can also use the \"Custom Prompt\" mode to set up an additional role.\n\n2. Specify.\n\nThe more details you provide, the more relevant and personalized the response will be.\n\n3. Limit.\n\nFor example:\nüîπ \"Suggest 3 solutions to the problem.\"\nüîπ \"Use no more than 10 words for each option.\"",
    "step3_1": "4. Specify the expected answer structure.\n\nFor example:\nüîπ \"Create a step-by-step algorithm and break down tasks into stages with subtasks.\"\n\n5. Specify an example or a style of communication.\n\nFor example:\nüîπ \"Rewrite this text in the same style as the following message.\"\nüîπ \"Write the response in the style of a letter: formal / informal / technical / conversational / humorous.\"",
    "step4": "<b>Bot Operation Modes</b>\n\nThe bot includes several modes of operation with ChatGPT:\n\n1. <b>Free Chat</b> ‚Äî generic request/response conversation. In this mode, ChatGPT remembers the history of the most recent messages. This is a universal mode suitable for conversations on open topics.\n\nFor example:\nüîπ \"Read and summarize the essence of the following text in 3 sentences.\"\nüîπ \"Explain how to learn to prioritize.\"\nüîπ \"Come up with 10 name options for a company that makes wooden children's toys.\"",
    "step4_1": "2. <b>Role</b> ‚Äî interacting with the bot in one of the preset roles, such as Coach, Psychologist, or Idea Generator. Within each role, the history is also saved, allowing you to resume the conversation from where you left off when you return.\n\n3. <b>Custom Prompt</b> ‚Äî an instruction that ChatGPT will keep in memory and consider when responding for the duration of your interaction. The \"Role\" mode also operates on similar instructions that are already \"embedded\" in <b>GPToid</b>.\n\nFor example:\nüîπ \"Act as an English teacher. I will write sentences, and you correct the mistakes and suggest what can be added.\"\n\n(Such a built-in role also exists!)",
    "step5": "<b>Plans and Products</b>\n\nAll users by default have access to the <b>\"Free\"</b> plan, which comes with limited number of requests. This plan provides access to <b>{{gptDefaultModelName}}</b> and allows to try image generation using <b>DALL-E</b>.\n\nIf you need more requests to <b>{{gptDefaultModelName}}</b> or access to <b>{{gptPremiumModelName}}</b> and <b>DALL-E</b>, consider purchasing one of the products (menu item \"Buy Products\" {{premiumCommand}}).",
    "step6": "<b>Gptokens, {{gptPremiumModelName}}, and DALL-E</b>\n\nThe <b>{{gptPremiumModelName}}</b> model is more advanced compared to <b>{{gptDefaultModelName}}</b>, capable of handling larger requests and providing higher-quality responses.\n\nThe <b>DALL-E</b> model generates images based on text prompts.\n\nBoth models are available with the purchase of üç• <b>gptokens</b> ({{premiumCommand}}) ‚Äî our special \"currency.\" One gptoken allows you to make {{usageText1}} to <b>{{gptPremiumModelName}}</b> (~1000 ChatGPT tokens each), and two gptokens enable you to create {{usageImage2}} of size {{imageSize}} in <b>DALL-E 3</b>.\n\nThus, a pack of {{gptoken100}} will suffice for {{usageText100}} to <b>{{gptPremiumModelName}}</b> or generating {{usageImage100}} images of size {{imageSize}}.",
